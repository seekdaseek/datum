# datum

**A solvency attestation that proves a lending book covers its debt at realisable exit prices — not oracle marks — without publishing a single position.**

Built in [Compact](https://docs.midnight.network/compact) for [Midnight](https://midnight.network).

> Status: in development. Toolchain gate passed — see [Toolchain](#toolchain). Circuit logic is being built now.

## The problem

Every solvency dashboard in DeFi values collateral at the oracle mark: the last traded price, multiplied by the number of tokens held. That number is a fiction the moment the book is large relative to the venue that would have to absorb it. Selling into a constant-product pool moves the price against you, so a book that reads as 130% collateralised at the mark can be under 100% the instant anyone tries to realise it. The gap between *marked* and *sellable* is where lending protocols die.

The honest measurement is public and mechanical: take the venue reserves, take the size you would have to sell, compute the proceeds. The obstacle is not the math — it is that publishing the position sizes to prove you did the math is exactly what a lender cannot do.

`datum` closes that gap. It proves the depth-adjusted realisable value of a book covers its debt at a required ratio, and it publishes nothing but the verdict and the public inputs anyone can recheck.

## What is public and what is private

The split is the whole design, and it is deliberate.

**Public** — lands on the ledger, independently recomputable by anyone:

| Input | Why public |
|---|---|
| Venue reserves `X`, `Y` per slot | On-chain state. Anyone can read it. |
| Venue identifier | Identifies which pool was used. |
| Block height per slot | Pins the reserves to a checkable moment. |
| Required collateral ratio (scaled) | The bar being cleared. Fixed at attestation time, never prover-chosen. |

**Private** — witness, never disclosed:

| Input | Why private |
|---|---|
| Position sizes `q` | The book. |
| Debt figure | The liability. |
| Claimed proceeds lower bounds `p` | Derived from the book; leaks it if revealed. |

Venue depth is not a secret and is not treated as one. An earlier draft of this design let the prover supply the haircut parameters privately — that put a publicly checkable number behind the veil and left the verdict resting on figures nobody could audit. Public inputs go on the ledger so a verifier recomputes them; only the book stays hidden.

## The math

Selling size `q` into a constant-product pool with reserves `(X, Y)` yields:

```
proceeds = Y*q / (X + q)
```

There is no division in a circuit. So the prover supplies `p` as a private witness, claimed to be a *lower bound* on those proceeds, and the circuit enforces the inequality instead:

```
per slot:   p_i * (X_i + q_i)  <=  Y_i * q_i
overall:    sum(p_i)           >=  debt * required_ratio
```

Claiming `p_i` too high violates the per-slot constraint and the proof fails. Claiming it too low only makes the book look worse than it is, which hurts the prover and never the verifier. Multiply and compare only — sound, and no division anywhere.

## Toolchain

Measured on the build machine. These are the versions the contract is known to compile under.

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| `compact` devtools | 0.5.2 |
| compiler | 0.34.0 |
| language | 0.26.0 |
| ledger | `ledger-9.1.0.0-rc.3` |
| runtime (`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`) | 0.19.0 |
| node / npm | v24.16.0 / 11.13.0 |

Note that the Compact reference docs still show `pragma language_version 0.16;` in the tutorial. The literal that compiles under language 0.26.0 is `pragma language_version 0.26;`. Where the docs and the compiler disagree, the compiler is right.

## Build

Compilation is positional — source first, then target directory:

```bash
compact compile --skip-zk contract/src/hello.compact build/hello
```

`--skip-zk` skips proving-key generation, which is slow. Drop it when real proofs are needed.

`contract/src/hello.compact` is a permanent toolchain smoke test, not part of the attestation logic. It exists so that a failure to compile can always be localised to either the toolchain or the contract, never ambiguously both.
